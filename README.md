# bookstore-devops-project

This is a sample DevOps project that demonstrates how to deploy a simple web application on **Azure** using:

- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation
- **Azure App Service** for hosting
- **Azure Monitor & Application Insights** for monitoring

The project mimics a real-world scenario where a company wants to automate deployments and manage infrastructure with modern DevOps practices.
